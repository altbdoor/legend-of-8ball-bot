# legend-of-8ball-bot

Pardon the ego, just a reference to a favorite film of mine, [The Legend of 1900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_1900).

A small Python 3.6.x Twitch bot that did a pretty damn good [Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball) impression.

For what its worth, the implementation is pretty shoddy, with poor attempts of
making it as good as possible.

Read up on its story in [story.md](story.md).
